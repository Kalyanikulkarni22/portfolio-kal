                <p>
                    I`ve always taken life as a journey from one experience to another. So far it has been a road full
                    of interesting events. Full of love and happiness and also there has been lots of letting go of
                    events, places, and people. I`ve never looked back on my
                    decisions and thought that any of them were wrong or not. I made a plan and kept walking on it
                    without regrettng anything. I`ve never stopped creating new life events because in my eyes life is a
                    pure act of creation full of opportunities
                    that arise from every new moment.
